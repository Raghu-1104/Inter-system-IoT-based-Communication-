# Inter-system-IoT-based-Communication-
communication between the microcontrollers and microprocessors in an IoT cluster network helps us to create and establish a reliable IoT Network

 The following repo contains codes for communication between the Raspberry pi pico to pico , pico to Raspberry Pi4 ( Micro Processor(master))  in the following communication protocols (UART, SPI, I2C)
